To get started with GORM for Neo4j you need to install the plugin into a Grails application.

For Grails 3.x you need to edit your `build.gradle` file and add the plugin as a dependency:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
	compile 'org.grails.plugins:neo4j:VERSION'
}
----


To do so for Grails 2.x edit the `grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy` file and add the following plugin definition, where `VERSION` is the version of the plugin you plan to use:


[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    compile ':neo4j:VERSION'
}
----

NOTE: GORM for Neo4j requires Grails 2.5.x or above and Neo4j 2.3.x or above

By default Neo4j will used as embedded database inside the JVM, the default directory for the Neo4j datastore is `data/neo4j`.
