http://www.neo4j.org[Neo4j] a Graph database that fits nicely in a Grails application.

The goal of GORM for Neo4j is to provide a 'as-complete-as-possible' GORM implementation that maps domain classes and instances to the Neo4j nodespace. The following features are supported:

* Marshalling from Neo4j Nodes to Groovy types and back again
* Support for GORM dynamic finders, criteria and named queries
* Session-managed transactions
* access to Neo4j's traversal capabilities
* Access the Neo4j graph database in all flavours (Embedded, REST and HA)
* Neo4j autoindexing
