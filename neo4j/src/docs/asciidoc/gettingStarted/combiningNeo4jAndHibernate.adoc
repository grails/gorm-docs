If you have both the Hibernate and Neo4j plugins installed then by default all classes in the `grails-app/domain`  directory will be persisted by Hibernate and not Neo4j. If you want to persist a particular domain class with Neo4j then you must use the `mapWith` property in the domain class:

[source,groovy]
----
static mapWith = "neo4j"
----
