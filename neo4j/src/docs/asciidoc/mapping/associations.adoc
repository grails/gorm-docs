GORM for Neo4j will create Neo4j relationships between nodes for you based on the relationship ownership rules defined in your GORM mapping. For example the following mapping:

[source,groovy]
----
class Owner {
    String name
    static hasMany = [pets:Pet]
}
class Pet {
    String name
    static belongsTo = [owner:Owner]
}
----

Will generate a Cypher relationship creation query as follows:

[source,groovy]
----
MATCH (from:Owner {__id__:{start}}), (to:Pet) WHERE to.__id__ IN {end} CREATE (from)-[r:PETS]->(to)
----

As you can see from the query the relationship is defined as `(from)-[r:PETS]->(to)`, with the direction of the association defined by who "owns" the association. Since `Pet` defines a `belongTo` association to `Owner`, this means that `Owner` owns the association and the relationship is from `Owner` to `Pet`.
