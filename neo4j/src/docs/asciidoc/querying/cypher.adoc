To query with raw Cypher queries you can use the built in `find` and `findAll` methods:

 [source,groovy]
----
def club = Club.find("MATCH n where n.name = {1} RETURN n", 'FC Bayern Muenchen')
 def clubs = Club.findAll("MATCH n where n.name = {1} RETURN n", 'FC Bayern Muenchen')
----

 Note that the first returned item should be the node itself. To execute cypher queries and work with the raw results use `cypherStatic`:

 [source,groovy]
----
Result result = Club.cypherStatic("MATCH n where n.name = {1} RETURN n", 'FC Bayern Muenchen')
----

 When working with raw results, you can convert any `org.neo4j.graphdb.Node` into a domain instance using the `as` keyword:

 [source,groovy]
----
Node myNode = ...
 Club club = myNode as Club
----

 You can also convert any `org.neo4j.graphdb.Result` instance to a list of domain classes:

 [source,groovy]
----
Result result = ...
  List<Club> clubs = result.toList(Club)
----
