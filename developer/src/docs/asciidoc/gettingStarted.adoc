=== Project Structure

The project is essentially a multi-project Gradle build. There is a core API and then subprojects that implement that API. The core API subprojects include:

* `grails-datastore-core` - The core API, this provides core interfaces for implementing a GORM provider
* `grails-datastore-gorm` - The runtime meta-programming and AST transformation infrastructure behind GORM. This also provides end users with APIs like `grails.gorm.CriteriaBuilder` and `grails.gorm.DetachedCriteria`
* `grails-datastore-gorm-support` - Support classes for easing the writing of a GORM plugin for Grails
* `grails-datastore-gorm-tck` - The TCK that includes hundreds of Spock specifications that a GORM implementation will need to pass
* `grails-datastore-web` - Classes required to integrate GORM into a web tier

In addition to this, there are separate projects of GORM implementations for various datastores:

* https://github.com/grails/gorm-hibernate4[GORM for Hibernate 4]
* https://github.com/grails/gorm-hibernate5[GORM for Hibernate 5]
* https://github.com/grails/gorm-mongodb[GORM for MongoDB]
* https://github.com/grails/gorm-neo4j[GORM for Neo4j]
* https://github.com/grails/gorm-redis[GORM for Redis]
* https://github.com/grails/gorm-cassandra[GORM for Cassandra]
