If you have both the Hibernate and Cassandra plugins installed then by default all classes in the `grails-app/domain` directory will be persisted by Hibernate and not Cassandra. 
If you want to persist a particular domain class with Cassandra then you must use the `mapWith` property in the domain class:

[source,groovy]
----
static mapWith = "cassandra"
----


By default the Hibernate plugin transparently adds an implicit `id` property of type `Long` to your domain class. The Cassandra plugin adds an `id` property of type `UUID`. 
If you install both plugins, the `id` property will be of type `Long`.
So if you have a domain class with an auto-generated `id` (the default behaviour) and you want to save it to both datastores, you should define a `UUID id` 
property as a `Long` won't really work for Cassandra. You also need to set the id's `generator` attribute so that the Hibernate plugin can auto-generate a `UUID`.
