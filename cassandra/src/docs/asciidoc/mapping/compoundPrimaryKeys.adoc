In Cassandra, a compound primary key consists of more than one column and treats only one column as the partition key. The other columns are treated as clustering columns.
To define a compound primary key on a domain class, each property that is part of the key has to be defined in the mapping block with a `primaryKey` map. Example:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person  {      
    
    String lastName
    String firstName    
    Integer age = 0
    String location   

    static mapping = {
        id name:"lastName", primaryKey:[ordinal:0, type:"partitioned"], generator:"assigned"     
        firstName index:true, primaryKey:[ordinal:1, type: "clustered"]   
        age primaryKey:[ordinal:2, type: "clustered"]     
        version false  
    }
}
----

The above mapping will generate the following Cassandra table if schema creation is on:

[source,groovy]
----
CREATE TABLE person (lastname text, firstname text, age int, location text, PRIMARY KEY (lastname, firstname, age))
----


==== Composite Partition Key

A composite partition key consists of multiple columns and treats more than one column as the partition key. The other columns are treated as clustering columns.
To define a composite partition key on a domain class, each property that is a part of the key has to have its `primaryKey type` attribute set to "partitioned". Example:
[source,groovy]
----
class Person  {      
    
    String lastName
    String firstName    
    Integer age = 0
    String location   

    static mapping = {
        id name:"lastName", primaryKey:[ordinal:0, type:"partitioned"], generator:"assigned"     
        firstName index:true, primaryKey:[ordinal:1, type: "partitioned"]   
        age index:true, primaryKey:[ordinal:0, type: "clustered"]     
        version false  
    }
}
...
CREATE TABLE person (lastname text, firstname text, age int, location text, PRIMARY KEY ((lastname, firstname), age))
----


==== The mapping block

The first column of the partition key is always mapped using `id`, and then the name of the actual property.


You should then add the `primaryKey` map to all columns of the compound/composite primary key. The two attributes are: 
* `ordinal` - specifies the order of the column in the compound/composite primary key. 
* `type` - "partitioned" or "clustered". For a compound primary key only one property is type "partitioned" and the rest are type "clustered". For a composite partition key more than one property is type "partitioned".


==== Persistence and Querying for Compound/Composite Primary Key domain classes

Where you need to pass in an id to a persistence or query method, use a map containing the components of the compound/composite primary key instead.

Example:

[source,groovy]
----
def person = Person.get([firstName:"Bob", lastName: "Wilson", age: 25])
Person.updateProperties([firstName:"Bob", lastName: "Wilson", age: 25], [location: "London"], [flush:true])
----
