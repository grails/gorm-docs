==== Basic Mapping


The way GORM for MongoDB works is to map each domain class to a Mongo collection. For example given a domain class such as:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    String firstName
    String lastName
    static hasMany = [pets:Pet]
}
----

This will map onto a MongoDB http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html[Collection] called "person".


==== Embedded Documents


It is quite common in MongoDB to embed documents within documents (nested documents). This can be done with GORM embedded types:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    String firstName
    String lastName
    Address address
    static embedded = ['address']
}
----

You can map embedded lists and sets of documents/domain classes:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    String firstName
    String lastName
    Address address
    List otherAddresses
    static embedded = ['address', 'otherAddresses']
}
----

You can also embed maps of embedded classes where the keys are strings:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    String firstName
    String lastName
    Map<String,Address> addresses
    static embedded = ['addresses']
}
----



==== Basic Collection Types


You can also map lists and maps of basic types (such as strings) simply by defining the appropriate collection type:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    List<String> friends
    Map pets
}

...

new Person(friends:['Fred', 'Bob'], pets:[chuck:"Dog", eddie:'Parrot']).save(flush:true)
----

Basic collection types are stored as native ArrayList and BSON documents within the Mongo documents.


==== Customized Collection and Database Mapping


You may wish to customize how a domain class maps onto a `MongoCollection`. This is possible using the `mapping` block as follows:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    ..
    static mapping = {
        collection "mycollection"
        database "mydb"
    }
}
----

In this example we see that the `Person` entity has been mapped to a collection called "mycollection" in a database called "mydb".

You can also control how an individual property maps onto a Mongo Document field (the default is to use the property name itself):

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    ..
    static mapping = {
        firstName attr:"first_name"
    }
}
----

If you are using the mapping engine, for non-embedded associations by default GORM for MongoDB will map links between documents using MongoDB http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/database-references/[database references] also known as `DBRefs`.

If you prefer not to use DBRefs then you tell GORM to use direct links by using the `reference:false` mapping:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    ..
    static mapping = {
        address reference:false
    }
}
----
