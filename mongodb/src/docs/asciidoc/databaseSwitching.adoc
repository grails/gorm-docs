In addition to storing dynamic attributes, as of version 1.3.0 of the plugin you can also switch which database and/or collection to persist to at runtime. 

For example:

[source,groovy]
----
Person.withDatabase("administrators") {
    new Person(name:"Bob").save()
}
----

The above example will save a `Person` instance to the 'administrators' database. The database is used for the scope of the closure. You can switch database for the scope of the active session:

[source,groovy]
----
Person.useDatabase("administrators") 
new Person(name:"Bob").save()
----

In addition, there are equivalent `withCollection` and `useCollection` methods for switching collection at runtime.
