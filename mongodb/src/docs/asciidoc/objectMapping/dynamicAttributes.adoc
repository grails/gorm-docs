Unlike a relational database, MongoDB allows for "schemaless" persistence where there are no limits to the number of attributes a particular document can have. A GORM domain class on the other hand has a schema in that there are a fixed number of properties. For example consider the following domain class:

[source,groovy]
----
class Plant {
    boolean goesInPatch
    String name
}
----

Here there are two fixed properties, `name` and `goesInPatch`, that will be persisted into the MongoDB document. Using GORM for MongoDB you can however use dynamic properties via the Groovy subscript operator. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
def p = new Plant(name:"Pineapple")
p['color'] = 'Yellow'
p['hasLeaves'] = true
p.save()

p = Plant.findByName("Pineapple")

println p['color']
println p['hasLeaves']
----

Using the subscript operator you can add additional attributes to the underlying `Document` instance that gets persisted to the MongoDB allowing for more dynamic domain models.
