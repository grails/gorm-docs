===== Description


The `useDatabase` method allows switching, at runtime, the database used persist and retrieve domain classes. The `DB` property will return the current database being used. Note that the method switches the database used for the scope of the current session/connection (ie. it is not permanent). If you wish to permanently change the database used then you need to configure the mapping of the domain class.
