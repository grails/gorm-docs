If you plan to use MongoDB as your primary datastore then you need to remove the Hibernate plugin from the `build.gradle` file by commenting out the hibernate line in the plugins block

[source,groovy]
----
compile 'org.grails.plugins:hibernate'
----

With this done all domain classes in grails-app/domain will be persisted via MongoDB and not Hibernate. You can create a domain class by running the regular `create-domain-class` command:

[source,groovy]
----
grails create-domain-class Person
----

The `Person` domain class will automatically be a persistent entity that can be stored in MongoDB.
