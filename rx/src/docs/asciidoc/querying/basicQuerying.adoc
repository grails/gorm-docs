To query for a single instance by identifier you can use the `get(id)` method:

[source,groovy]
----
Book.get(id)
    .subscribe { Book it ->
    println "Title = ${it.title}"
}
----


To query for a `List` of objects you can use the `list()` method:

[source,groovy]
----
Book.list()
    .subscribe { List<Book> books ->
    for(book in books)
        println "Title = ${book.title}"
}
----

However, for large data sets it is better to use the `findAll()` method which will return each result in a reactive manner rather than load the entire list into memory:

[source,groovy]
----
Book.findAll()
    .subscribe { Book it ->
    println "Title = ${it.title}"
}
----

To return the first result you can use the `first()` method:

[source,groovy]
----
Book.first()
    .subscribe { Book it ->
    println "Title = ${it.title}"
}
----

And conversely to return the last result you can use the `last()` method:

[source,groovy]
----
Book.last()
    .subscribe { Book it ->
    println "Title = ${it.title}"
}
----
