Where queries are the preferred way to build more complex queries. They are type safe, expressive and lazily executed:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Book.where {
    title == 'The Stand'
}
----

Note that no query is actually executed directly, instead the `where(Closure)` method returns an instance of link:api/grails/gorm/rx/DetachedCriteria.html[DetachedCriteria].

Like an `rx.Observable`, the `DetachedCriteria` class can be subscribed to:


[source,groovy]
----
Book.where {
    title == 'The Stand'
}.subscribe { Book it ->
    println "Title = ${it.title}"
}
----

Alternatively you can execute one of the query methods to invoke the query and return an `rx.Observable`:


[source,groovy]
----
Book.where {
    title == 'The Stand'
}.list().subscribe { List<Book> books ->
    for(book in books)
        println "Title = ${book.title}"
}
----

For more information on the syntax of where queries see the http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/GORM.html#whereQueries[relevant section in the GORM documentation].
