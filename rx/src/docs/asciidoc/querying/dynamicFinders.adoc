Although _Where queries_ are preferred, _Dynamic finders_ are another option for simple queries and are also very expressive. The https://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#finders[syntax for Dynamic finders is described in the GORM user guide]. The major difference in RxGORM is that all dynamic finders return an `rx.Observable`:

[source,groovy]
----
Book.findByAuthor("Stephen King")
    .subscribe { Book book ->
        println "Title = ${book.title}"
    }
