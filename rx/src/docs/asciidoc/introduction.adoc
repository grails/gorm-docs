http://gorm.grails.org[GORM], the object mapping technology built into the Grails framework, has traditionally been a primarily blocking API.

Async features were added in GORM 4, however these are merely a way to isolate your blocking operations onto a different thread and not a truly non-blocking implementation.

RxGORM builds ontop of http://reactivex.io[RxJava] and provides a completely non-blocking, stateless implementation of GORM.

Currently only MongoDB is supported as a backing store, however implementations are planned for SQL, REST client and other NoSQL datastores in the future (subject to driver support)

NOTE: RxGORM is still at the milestone phase and this document is still evolving and subject to change!
