In the previous section we discussed the implications of association proxies for single-ended associations, however the same applies with many-ended associations.

In the case of collection types, these implement the link:api/grails/gorm/rx/collection/RxPersistentCollection.html[RxPersistentCollection] and again can be subscribed to:


[source,groovy]
----
Author author == ... // load author
author.books.subscribe { Collection<Book> books ->
    for(Book book in books)
        println "Book: ${book.title}"
}
----

Like single-ended associations you can also use a join query to eagerly fetch the association and avoid having to subscribe to it in order to achieve a non-blocking outcome.
