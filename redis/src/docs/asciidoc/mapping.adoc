Object mapping works largely as described in the http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/latest/guide/GORM.html[documentation on GORM]. In general you can continue to model your associations using typical GORM notation such as `hasMany`, `belongsTo` and so on.

The one notable exception is that the http://grails.org/doc/latest/ref/Database%20Mapping/Usage.html[mapping block] works differently to GORM for Hibernate. Most of the mapping configuration options available to GORM for Hibernate are specific to SQL databases and hence don't make sense to Redis.

Here is an example of a domain class that can be persisted to Redis:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {

    String firstName
    String lastName

    static constraints = {
        firstName blank:false
        lastName blank:false
    }

    static mapping = {
        lastName index:true
    }
}
----

Note that one key difference with GORM for Redis is that you *must* specify the properties you want to index before you can execute any query against the property. In the example above the `lastName` property can be queried with a dynamic finder such as:

[source,groovy]
----
Person.findByLastName("Simpson")
----

However, the `firstName` property cannot be queried and an error will be thrown if you attempt the equivalent dynamic finder for the `firstName` property unless you specify `index:true` for that property too.

In other words, unlike SQL where every single property can be queried with Redis you must specify which properties can be queried up front.
