If you have both the Hibernate and Redis plugins installed then by default all classes in the `grails-app/domain` directory will be persisted by Hibernate and not Redis. If you want to persist a particular domain class with Redis then you must use the `mapWith` property in the domain class:

[source,groovy]
----
static mapWith = "redis"
----
