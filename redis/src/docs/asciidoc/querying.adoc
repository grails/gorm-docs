As mentioned in the previous section you must specify the properties that can be queried with `index:true` in your mapping block. Once a property can be queried upon then there are several ways to do it including:

* http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/latest/guide/GORM.html#finders[Dynamic Finders]
* http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/latest/guide/GORM.html#criteria[Criteria]
* http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/latest/guide/GORM.html#whereQueries[Where Queries]

These queries operate in largely the same way as they do with GORM for Hibernate. Note, however, that each criterion used in a query results in querying another index and although GORM for Redis caches query results you should be careful not to use too many criteria as it will impact query performance.

A good way to debug your query performance is to go to your Redis distribution and type the following in a command or terminal window:

[source,groovy]
----
$ ./redis-cli
$ MONITOR
----

The `MONITOR` command will allow you to monitor the commands that the currently running Redis server is receiving and responding to. Great for debugging!
