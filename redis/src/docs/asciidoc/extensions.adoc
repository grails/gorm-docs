As well as all the regular capabilities offered by the GORM API there are a couple of additional GORM methods that take advantage of some key Redis features. The first one is the <<ref-domain-classes-random,random>> method which will return a random instance of the domain class:

[source,groovy]
----
def randomPerson = Person.random()
----

Implementing a random function in a SQL database is typically quite hard to do in a performant way whilst something like Redis makes it easy.

There is also a <<ref-domain-classes-pop,pop>> method that will return and remove a random domain instance in one step:

[source,groovy]
----
def randomPerson = Person.pop()
----
